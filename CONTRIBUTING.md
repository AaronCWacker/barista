## How to Contribute

Now that we have the disclaimer out of the way, let's get into how you can be a part of our project. There are many different ways to contribute.

### Issues

We track our work using Issues in GitHub. Feel free to open up your own issue to point out areas for improvement or to suggest your own new experiment. If you are comfortable with signing the waiver linked above and contributing code or documentation, grab your own issue and start working.

### Pull Requests

If you've gotten as far as reading this section, then thank you for your suggestions.

### Paperwork for Pull Requests

* Please read this guide and make sure you agree with our [Individual Contributor License Agreement ("ICL")](INDIVIDUAL_CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE.md).
* Make sure git knows your name and email address:
   ```
   $ git config user.name "J. Random User"
   $ git config user.email "j.random.user@example.com"
   ```
* The first time you do a pull request, you will be asked to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

### General Guidelines

Ensure your pull request (PR) adheres to the following guidelines:

* Try to make the name concise and descriptive.
* Give a good description of the change being made. Since this is very subjective, see the [Updating Your Pull Request (PR)](#updating-your-pull-request-pr) section below for further details.
* Every pull request should be associated with one or more issues. If no issue exists yet, please create your own.
* Make sure that all applicable issues are mentioned somewhere in the PR description. This can be done by typing # to bring up a list of issues.

#### Updating Your Pull Request (PR)

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. This applies to both the content documented in the PR and the changed contained within the branch being merged. There's no need to open a new PR. Just edit the existing one.
